Thank you for choosing Drunk Man! :)

A camera effect shader which simulate vision of drunk man.
"Demo.unity" demonstrate how to use the drunk shader.
"DemoURP.unity" is the corresponding URP demo.
There are plenty of parameters to control drunk effect, for highly customizable variations.

Open demo scene and click the play button, I guess you will feel drunken.
